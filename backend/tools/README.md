This folder contains developer tools and one-off scripts used for debugging, backfills, and local testing.

Move scripts here if they're not intended to be used by production scheduled jobs.

Examples:
- check_payments.js
- inspect_db.js
- print_payments.js
- signup_test.js

Be careful: scripts in `tools/` are not expected to be added to production cron jobs.
