Personal Information
I grew up on a farm in a small town of Superior, Pennsylvania. My early influences were all centered on food. My grandparents grew and sold
their own vegetables and meats. Dennis Turkey Farm was known for its customer satisfaction and â€˜clean farm' practices. I learned about
environmental stewardship from grandparents that farmed holistically. I fondly remember working with Grandpa Dennis, plucking turkey feathers
and processing chickens to fill the latest orders.Inside the farmhouse, I sat wide eyed watching my grandmother make what seemed like magic in
her big wooden bowl filling the orders for our family restaurant called Glisans .I credit my grandmother for instilling within me the passion for
savory and baking and using all of the chef senses! I have worked practically all of my life in some form within the hospitality world. I am very
creative, positive, warm, personable with strong attention to detail and management skills. I pride myselfon quality of work with a strong work
ethic. I pride myself on high customer satisfaction and client retention. I am a true leader and a fantastic administrator and teacher.

Summary
At the Culinary Institute of America, I was taught and mentored by an expert team of world renowned chefs and professors with outstanding
industry and education credentials. I gained extensive exposure and experience through the advanced culinary curriculum that is only offered at
CIA. My education went beyond memorizing and executing foods, cooking techniques and recipes - I learned how to analyze foods, how to adapt
them, and most important ... how to get creative with them. I am well trained in both classic and contemporary culinary methods and techniques
and developed a strong understanding of how to prepare a wide variety of global cuisines, as well as, wine & beer pairing.
I have had the opportunity to work with famed Chef Larry Forgione ""The Godfather of American Cuisine"" (father of Iron Chef Marc Forgione)
Learning the true practice of sourcing local ingredients into the restaurant known as farm-to-table cooking. I gained extensive hands-on experience
in CIA professional kitchens and bakeshops, and in their award-winning student-staffed restaurants (including the American Bounty Restaurant,
and Ristorante Caterina de' Medici, St. Andrews Restaurant). I gained both back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house experience under the
guidance of the expert faculty and through a 5 month externship at Walt Disney World's 3rd signature premier restaurant ""Artist Point"" in Orlando,
Florida at the Wilderness Lodge in Magic Kingdom. Additionally, I gained solid professional experience at Cattail Creek Country club in
Maryland, running the private catering businesses.

Professional Summary
I have honed my professional craft by working in New York City (most recently Gastro Arte and Oxford Kitchen Fort Greene Brooklyn),
Hoboken, Oaxaca Mexico, as well as presiding over two top rated, highly coveted award winning well known extremely high volume Knowles
family restaurants and hotel in New Jersey in which my skills were perfected and completed in all aspects of running award winning restaurants.
With this comes a proven track record and an excellent reputation .After my time at the Highlawn, I was given the reigns of their sister restaurant
The Manor as the Chef D' Cuisine because of my work ethic, dedication to my staff and my craft. With the opportunity to run my own
establishment, I was brought on to open gastro pubs such as Sixty Park next door to the PAC Center and the Tap House Grill. I opened these
establishments as upscale casual and rustic comfort food with banquet and catering on site to excellent reviews and a steady following. I am also
heavily involved as a lead chef consultant for creating successful menus and kitchen designs to open such restaurants as Halcyon and Montclair
Station in Montclair NJ and Bistro Seven Three in Bernardsville. I stand by my food with simple and colorful plate designs with bold flavors and
my ability to train and inspire my staff with my progressive and lead by example philosophy. With me you will get a loyal hardworking chef with a
love of our industry. I take my craft seriously bringing no ego just passion, pride and ambition number. I am available to interview at your earliest
convenience if you believe I meet your standards.

Personal Information
Lakeland College Kirtland, OH, United States Although it is not a degree for the culinary field, I have been able to apply this degree to my career
and it has helped me along in my career obtain various management positions within the culinary field, which I have excelled in in my nine plus years
of this profession. My goal is to one day become an executive chef and I feel at this point I will reach it one day soon. Cooking has become a
strong passion of mine to where cooking jobs do not feel like jobs anymore, its more like a fun way to live my life day to day able to wake up
excited to go learn new cooking skills and make people excited about visiting our restaurant, well which ever one I am working in at the time. High
School Diploma: Culinary Arts (Vocational School at Beechwood High School) 2005 Charles F Brush Lyndhurst, OH, United States While
attending Brush High School (My high School) I also attended Beechwood High School from my Junior year (11th Grade) to my senior Year
(12th Grade) to study culinary arts where we learned the basics of cooking. I was interested in how to become a cook and how to make various
dishes so I would e able to cook meals for my family at home. During high school, although I was in the Culinary Arts program, at the time it did
not keep my interest, so when I graduated I got into the Business management field, while attending college I began working as a dishwasher at
Houlihans and was intrigued again by working in the kitchen, so much that I was able to be promoted to prep cook and from there I started my
Culinary Career. Each year they have it here in Cleveland, and if I am Available, I work at our annual Air show as a cook vendor if there is an
opportunity for me. I also like to volunteer to cook for the homeless at our Cleveland Food Bank, during the holidays which I have not been able
to do recently, but I do love being able to put smiles on everyone during the holidays with exceptional and delightful meals.

Experience
Company Name City , State Sushi Chef 10/2014 to Current
Working at Wasabi's Downtown entailed the same tasks a sushi chef as Sushi Time, only I am now second chef instead of head chef. I feel like I
am again coming to the point where I would like a new opportunity to start from the bottom as I have done in the past at Sushi Time and The 5
Spot.
Company Name City , State Dishwasher/ Line Cook 04/2014 to 10/2014
Working at The 5 Spot was a really awesome experience for me. It provided some of the more conventional style kitchen and line cook
experience that I had not so much been exposed to at Sushi Time. I also started off at the dishwashing position here. Although I was only there for
a short period of time, the exposure to this type of kitchen environment was something that I had been missing in my culinary experience. It also
posed a challenge for me since I have been mostly making sushi for the better part of the last few years. The 5 Spot was a highly fast-paced
neighborhood kitchen. So, you had to be quick all around and good knife skills are a must. I really enjoyed the challenge of once again having to
start all over from the bottom and work my way back up. I ended up leaving The 5 Spot due to constant management changes and an offer to
work for my old boss again.
Company Name City , State Host, Server, Dishwasher, Cook 03/2008 to 03/2014
Sushi Time Towa is the first restaurant i have worked for. I have been employed by Sushi Time for six years where I started at the very bottom
and worked my way to the top. I have worked as a host and as a server which consisted of me greeting customers, helping them to their seats,
grabbing their drinks and orders and doing my best to give them the utmost service and keep a smile on their face. I worked as a host/server for
about a year, so most of my time has really been spent working in the kitchen and making sushi. In order for me to work my way up through the
ranks to sushi, I started at the very bottom in the dish pit. This consisted of me washing all dishes, pots, pans, and silverware. I was also required
to prep meats and veggies. Having started at the dish/prep position, these tasks really helped me build a strong work ethic and develop great knife
skills as well. I then moved over to cooking which consisted of still participating with prep work, but also cooking and frying all orders. Prep
consisted of cutting chicken, beef, shrimp, squid, and all types of veggies. I have been doing sushi now for 3 years. That is, Monday-Saturday 10-
10, give or take a few hours. I have had random days off here and there and some holidays, but for the most part 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.
I have developed such a passion for food and seeing a smile on a person's face when they bite into the food and love it. I love being in an
environment conducive for success and working hard while loving what I do. Being a sushi chef at Sushi Time consists of a wide range of tasks.
I've received serve safe managerial training, so I am in charge of making sure everything is clean and up to code. I'm also in charge of going over
inventory; ranging from paper/plastics, to all meats and veggies, also drinks and alcohol. This task also means I must handle all ordering trough the
different distributors and vendors we may use. My job requires me on a daily basis to: cook and marinate rice, cut and prepare fish for the day,
making sushi-rolls, nigiri, sashimi, platters etc. Im also required to assist customers sitting at the sushi bar with any inquiries or concerns they may
have. Over the course of the 6 years i have been employed by Towa, I have gained so much. Ive matured so much through this job and sushi really
has become such a passion of mine. I am a really hard worker who is also fun to work with, who is merely seeking a new opportunity to further my
skill set and continue doing what i love. I have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. And I have no problem adjusting to any style or
training. I will work any days/nights or weekends and holidays if necessary.
