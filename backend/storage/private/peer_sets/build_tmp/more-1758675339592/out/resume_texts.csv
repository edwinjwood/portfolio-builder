An effective resume should do two things: 1. Describe where you’ve been and 2. Foretell where
you're going.

resume should be a carefully crafted document that helps employers clearly see the value you will
bring to their organization. This can general be done in a one page document that clearly

ADDITIONAL RESUME STYLES
You may be considering an internship or employment setting where a traditional resume (like the example in this packet)
is not the only appropriate type of resume. Talk to a Career Development Coach to determine if one of these additional
resume styles is appropriate for your career goals.
FEDERAL RESUME
 A Federal resume provides your qualifications for a position in great detail.
 Federal resumes are generally 2-5 pages in length and include similar language as the vacancy announcement.
 A Federal resume includes additional information not typically requested in the private sector, including:
 Job Information (announcement number, title, series, and grade of the job you’re applying for)
 Personal Information (including SSN, country of citizenship, and reinstatement eligibility)
See our tip sheet at www.sc.edu/career/Pdf/federalresume.pdf for more information.
CURRICULM VITAE (CV)
 A CV or Curriculum Vitae (meaning one’s life in Latin) is generally preferred in these specific industries:
 Academic, Scientific, Research, Teaching, Medical, Graduate program application, Grant & Fellowship
application and International applications.
 It is generally 2 or more pages in length and emphasizes an individual’s qualifications and activities.
 There is no standard formatting for a CV.
View our tip sheet at www.sc.edu/career/Pdf/Vita.pdf. Set up an appointment
with your Career Development Coach to structure your CV.
CREATIVE RESUMES / ONLINE PORTFOLIOS
 You may be considering an industry where creativity is encouraged. A creative resume is one way to showcase
your creativity and experience to a potential employer.
 Consider your audience when creating a resume that is not designed in the traditional format.
 Include the same information you would on a traditional resume, just in a different format.
 Name and Contact information
 Education
 Experience
 Activities/ Interests
 Skills/Programs/Software
FUNCTIONAL / COMBINATION RESUME
 A functional resume allows you to group your work history by skills rather than in chronological order, for example:
 Sales and New Account Development
 Customer Relations
 A functional resume may be helpful for those who are in career transition, have employment gaps, or have too
little experience when applying for jobs.
 A combination resume lists your skills and experience at the top of your resume, followed by your employment
history.
 This can be used to highlight skills you have that are relevant for the job you are applying too, while also
providing a chronological work history.

Cover Letters
A cover letter is an opportunity to demonstrate to an employer that you have researched their company and have
relevant experiences that would benefit their company mission and the position they are hiring for. The purpose of the
cover letter is to arouse the employer’s interest and gain his/her attention to your application for employment.
When possible, a cover letter should always accompany your resume when applying for a position.
TIPS FOR WRITING AN EFFECTIVE COVER LETTER
 Research the company and related positions to find the important skills needed for their industry.
a. Your goal is to match your skills, knowledge and traits with the position, company, and industry in your
cover letter. To do this, you must have a strong understanding of what the company is looking for in an
ideal candidate.
b. Research facts about the company, their mission, vision, values, and current news and trends in
their industry.
 Always address the letter to the appropriate individual by name and professional title. This may involve calling HR
to obtain a specific name.
a. If you are not able to obtain a name, address it to the apparent job title of the individual receiving your
application, “Dear Hiring Manager” or “Dear Human Resources Director”.
 Attract the employer’s attention by beginning your cover letter with a strong statement.
a. Many employers receive hundreds of applications and you want yours to be the one that is remembered.
b. Develop a bridge or common bond between you and the employer. Tell how you learned of the
organization and/or vacancy.
 Tell why you’re interested in the employer. Indicate what you can do for the employer rather than what the
employer can do for you.
a. You can combine this with your first paragraph when you are gaining their attention, or this can be a
separate paragraph all on its own.
 Always thank the employer for their time and consideration.
a. If sending electronically, make sure you type “Sincerely” and print your name. An electronic signature is
not expected.

Dear Dr./Ms./Mr. _______________________: or:
Dear Recruiting Manager:
First Paragraph: ATTENTION: In your Initial paragraph, indicate the reason for writing, the specific position or type of
work for which you are applying, and how you learned of the opening. (Include prior contact with an employer or
employees of the organization you are applying to, newspaper advertisements, Handshake, a job fair, etc.). Remember:
This is the paragraph where you initially hook them, so make it exciting!
Second Paragraph: INTEREST: Mention why you are interested in the position, the organization, its products or services.
This is the number one item that most students leave out of the cover letter. Show the reader that you have done your
research and know what makes them unique and/or stand out from their competitors. Make it clear that you are interested
in the position for more than just a J-O-B. You can combine this paragraph with the first paragraph if you prefer.
Third Paragraph: FIT: If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background and experiences make you a
qualified candidate for the position. If you have related work or internship experience, point this out by mentioning specific
achievements or unique qualifications gained through this experience. It can be helpful to choose 2-3 specific experiences
from your resume that demonstrate your fit with the company. Do not repeat information word for word as it appears on
your resume. Make sure that you are not beginning each sentence with the word “I”. Above all, indicate the skills
that you have gained and what you can do for the employer.
Fourth Paragraph: FOLLOW-UP: In the closing paragraph, indicate that you are very interested in an interview. You may
suggest a time frame for when you will be available or will follow-up. Make some final connection between the available
position and your qualifications. Finally, thank the employer for his/her time and consideration.
