Advocate General
August 2014 to Current Company Name
Provides oversight for state operated and private facilities licensed or contracted with the Department of Mental Health Developed the
Advocacy Conditional Release Monitoring Program with immediate success by locating and reporting consumers that are non-compliant
with medication, court orders and state rules Carefully analyzing historical comments, ratings and input from consumers using the grievance
process allowed us to highlight negative trends prior to becoming major problems, as a result the number of consumer grievances dropped
almost 50% since being appointed Advocate General Monitoring and reviewing critical incident reports from facilities resulted in a
collaboration that prompted facility representatives to engage consumers and families to offer assistance, an explanation or other appropriate
support that soothed initial anger and potentially prevented lawsuits.
This was a huge factor in the 34% decrease in critical incidents being reported from 8/2014 to 8/2015 Collaborating with the Oklahoma
Forensic Review Board regarding consumers found not guilty by reason of insanity while providing input and advice on current behaviors
and trends strengthened relationships between the governor appointed board and the department By participating in treatment team
meetings of consumers found not guilty by reason of insanity and those never to attain competency, focusing on risk assessments,
progression through the program and potential placement for the consumers, we were able to streamline the phases of the program making it
more productive and efficient Staying aware of the state budget status, I was able to make appropriate adjustments while managing this
division's budget.
As a result this division finished the fiscal year 20% under budget allowing the savings to be passed on to divisions where services were
being cut.
