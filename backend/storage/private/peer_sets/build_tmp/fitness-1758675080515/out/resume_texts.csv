Professional Summary
I intend to practice general endocrinology; however I am pursuing additional training in the area of obesity medicine and hope to bring this
expertise to the practice I join. My background in nutrition science and exercise, as well as my clinical experience in weight management and
bariatric clinics, and research endeavors in clinical weight loss trials will enable me to develop the skills I need to supervise and direct patients in
their weight loss efforts. I am open to working in both the inpatient and outpatient setting as my fellowship training has equipped me to manage
inpatient diabetes and endocrine consults.
