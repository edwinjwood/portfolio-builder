Personal Information
A 76th street, 07047 Dear Ms. Gina Lucia The adds you have posted on your website mactches my qualifications in graphic art. I have
remarkable skills in digital, and graphic arts, and I would make a great designer in, and out of the field. I've had much experience with graphic, and
digital art in High School, and posted my artwork on my website. This skill has taught me many things about creativity. When I make art in any
design I notice that I am creating life on a blank piece of paper. To me making art is bringing the creativity to life, and to also give it any kind of
emotions to it. I have worked with many people who had more experience then me, and have already started to work under you. If you speak to
them they can tell you more about my designs. I am a hard worker, and I will always do my best to get the job done. I hope this has given you the
thought of allowing me to work under you. Hopefully we will have a chance to speak in person next week. Thank you for your time, and
consideration. Sincerely, Ethan Araya Ethan Araya

April 2015 Company Name ï¼​ City , State
Another volunteering experience that I found to be quite important with my skills and classes that I take is being a graphic designer for a Walk
Event for my school. The opportunity for a graphic designer who would design a poster/flier for the Walk for Suicide event was open and I choose
to create a design and submit it for the chance to be featured. My responsibilities involved creating a design that would clearly express the beliefs
of the Walk for Suicide event, state information such as the event time and address, and to intrigue the eye and to create interest overall. The event
was something I believed to be very important so I took my time on creating the design which took a 2 days, with my ability to create and deliver
in a timely manner. My design was actually chosen and used on different social medias of the event and was an experience that I believe helped me
learn more about time management, deadlines, communication of information while doing something I enjoy.
Cashier/Waiter/Greeter
March 2013 Company Name ï¼​ City , State
A volunteering experience that I took part in was a Dog Fair back in 2013, it was an opportunity for people to come into the fair and find dogs
that they wanted to adopt and also a chance for dog owners to come in with their dogs and participate in Dog races, raffles, and purchase many
other dog related things in support of the Dog adoption agency to care for the other dogs that had currently not been adopted yet. My first
volunteer job there was a greeter for everyone who had entered the fair, I was to record who came into the park, asking for any donations, and if
they wanted to participate in the races or raffles. As the fair days progressed and my skills had shown to improve around the fair goers, I was
upgraded to a waiter at many of the stands that were around to sell food. I up-sold the menu items, and beverages to increase the profits that
would go towards donations for the dogs. I took the necessary steps to meet customer needs and to resolve any food or service issues. I was able
to record the orders, repeat them back in a clear, understandable manner and communicated with the other volunteers. I rotated around, taking on
the responsibilities of a cashier, waiter, and greeter to provide the highest service I could give.

This retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state.Â The family had
recently hired a new, young general manager.Â He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent
company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down.Â

Owner/Manager Company Name â€“ City , State
Converted 7500 square feet of commercial space into 24 individual offices of varying sizes, several cubicle spaces, large and small conference
rooms, reception area, secretarial work area and lounge.
Individual offices were rented to independent business persons by the month, cubicles by the day or hour.Â All phone calls answered by staff and
messages taken.Â Secretarial services available to tenants, as well as outside clients, for an hourly fee.Â Conference rooms available on a daily
or hourly basis.Â Other business services included hosting meetings or conferences and publishing marketing materials for tenants and outside
clients.
Building was sold in 1993 and new owner had other plans for the space and refused to renew the lease.Â I had moved the business once and
paid for build-out of this space.Â I couldn't afford to move again; decided to close business instead.
Current
Principal Company Name â€“ City , State
Consulted with clients to determine architectural preference to meet overall design goals.
Originated and developed creative design concepts.
Assisted clients with budget considerations regarding products and materials.
Successfully resolved complex technical design issues.
Interfaced with architects, contractors, sub-contractors, consultants, fabricators, and regulatory agencies.
Specified proper products and materials for each project.
Prepared construction documents and details to implement design concepts.
Established at the time of graduation from design school, I began my independent career, on a full-time basis.Â When business was slow (due to
recession, etc.) I accepted employment with well established firms.Â I have continued to serve many repeat clients and referrals over the years.
Transitional Vocation
In 1981, before the advent and common use of CAD programs, I had a serious injury to my right (drawing) hand.Â I was owner of income
properties and had been managing income propertiesfor other individual owners.Â Since I was not going to be able to use my hand again for
drawing for some time, I took a position as a manager of a 160 unit apartment project that was only 50% occupied.Â Within six months, all units
were rehabbed, rentable and occupied, and 95-100% occupancy was maintained while I was manager.Â
In 1983, I was offered a position with another firm as Project Manager during construction and Start-Up Manager of a 360 unit apartment
complex.Â Being involved at the inception, I was able to revise apartment floor plans to made accommodation for the most common objections I
heard while marketing existing floor plans.Â My revised plans were very successful and apartments were filled as fast as they were built, with a
long waiting list.Â Approximately 1/3 of the tenants from the first project I had managed, moved to the new complex, which was extremely
gratifying.Â I continued in this position to the end of construction.Â During that time, I attended property management courses and earned a
Residential Property Management Certificate.
My hand was rehabilitated by this time and I decided it was time to return to my real passion, interior design. Â
