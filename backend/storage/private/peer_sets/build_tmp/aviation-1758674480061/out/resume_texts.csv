Company Name City Aerospace Engineer 01/2014 to 01/2015
Member of the AIAA and the front line team that developed a novel cooling design system for turbine blades.
Throughout this process, computational fluid dynamic software (STARCCM) and CAD were highly implemented to simulate different
geometries inside a wind tunnel.
Pressures, temperatures, velocities among other important physical quantities were analyzed in 40 different geometries.
This project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency.
It is not a secret in today's industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling
impingement, which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine.
Also, it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels.
Upon this experiment, a research paper was written and patented.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS Personal: Due to specialized training and procurement practices the City of Peoria had an annual savings of
$1500.00 annually on costs of goods acquired by purchase order during career.
By developing a spreadsheet to record material requisitions and receiving logs, our department was able to stop purchasing preprinted
forms from local vendor, as a result monthly operational cost were reduced.
Man hours during cycle counts and order pulling were also reduced through consolidating bulk inventory into more manageable amounts
with the use of poly-bags rather than just dumping items into bin boxes.

Accomplishments
Our ship was in trouble when the right terminal shaft of the woodward governor that connects the governor to the injection pumps was
broken while we were Somewhat near the Aleutian island in Alaska. The emergency speed of the ship was activated but that is too slow. I
suggested to modified the linkage connection by using the left side terminal shaft of the governor. Then we were able to reach safely the port
of Ketchikan, Alaska.
When the power turbine blades of one of our Gas Turbine Engine were all broken, our chief Engineer asked me if we can replace it? This
procedure were never done before me. I studied the video and bought a hydraulic jack and fabricate special tools so that we can separate
the compressor from the combustion chamber. We recorded the hydraulic pressure when we had loosen the nut of the long stud bolt that
hold the compressor and the combustion chamber, we used the same pressure when we put it back.
There was a power outage, after the resumption of the power supply we lost the program of the PLC that controls our reverse osmosis
plant.Since we don't have the program, we temporary
convert the control by installing relays, magnetic contactors and
timers and rewire it so that all sensors will function to protect the
equipment and resume our much needed operation.

Experience
January 2011
to
Current
Company Name City , State Purchaser / Production Coordinator
My journey at Flightstar began with production coordinating, where I was responsible for interfacing with leads, project managers, and
customer representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule.
In this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits.
I worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these
parts as necessary.
When services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate
paperwork to purchasing.
Daily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task.
Being a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more
closely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues.
Like coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives.
In addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed
accurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source.
Being on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where
buyers spend more time on parts themselves.
Purchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed.
I have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal.
If it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits.
Buyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed.
We then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary.
Outside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties.
In addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an
industry standard to rise above the competition.
Purchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs.
These savings of course benefits everyone on the company.
Purchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is
key in this position.
February 2009
to
December 2010
Company Name City , State Purchasing Clerk / Material Specialist
Working with Vision Airlines included a lot of different responsibilities.
Not only was I responsible for quoting and purchasing materials for both Aircraft and Stock, but also included Stores / Warehouse,
Shipping, and Receiving responsibilities.
Being a smaller Airline I work closely with the Executive staff as well as the owners of the company themselves.
After receiving a Material Order Request, I would acquire the necessary quotes to find the best price and lead time available.
If needed, get approval to proceed with the order.
Coordinate and expedite the shipping and payment process to get the material where it needs to be in a timely manner.
I would match invoice with purchase orders and track shipments to assure their arrival.
Upon receipt of material, I then would verify proper certification of the material, receive into the system, and label as required.
Once material is ready to be used, issue from the system to assure all records was correct.
All of this required constant tracking using Excel, Word, and Adobe.
I kept records of all transactions whether it was materials needing to be ordered, Purchase Orders themselves, Invoices needing to be paid,
or items that that have already been received.
As well as certifications and any other information requested from maintenance.
If an item needed to be shipped I was responsible for the proper packaging, handling, and traceability to be done in a professional manner.
As part of the AOG team I would be called on at any time to locate and facilitate the material where the urgent requirement may be.
This involved having key information to acquire the material and coordinate with the proper logistics necessary.
Also as a valued member of the material group I have represented the Airline at maintenance facilities to properly manage the material being
ordered and used for an Aircraft.
February 2005
to
January 2009
Company Name City , State Purchasing Agent / Material Expeditor
I started working as a Material Expeditor which required me to work closely with Purchasing, Maintenance, and the Airline.
Being an Expeditor had responsibilities that could change day by day depending on what was required of me.
I provided daily reports and expedited any material needed to keep the production process flowing efficiently.
This meant coordinating the order and shipment process, as well as the actual delivery of the material.
My responsibility as a Purchasing Agent is to find price and availability on material needed and then order and track for prompt shipment.
This requires me to deal directly with the vendors and develop relationships for future business.
I also retrieve any and all paperwork required, retrieving certification, submit any and all signatures necessary, and expedite the material in a
timely fashion.
Once I have received the material I then facilitate and expedite the flow of materials to and from various departments.
I have worked with many different Airline companies as well as Military, which all have high and demanding standards to meet.
With this job no two days are the same, it is a constant change with challenging obstacles.
In addition to being a Buyer and Expeditor, I was responsible for doing spare Sales to sister and contract companies.
This required the technique of verifying stock, quoting material, ensuring proper certification, and shipping.
Between the three job functions I was constantly providing and coordinating AOG orders support.

Accomplishments
Preformed a comprehensive Analysis of the Federal Aviation Administrations En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) upgrade
I was a member of the Independent Operational Assessment (IOA) team that performed a comprehensive Analysis of the ERAM upgrade
to the National Air Space System (NAS). I performed in-depth triage of ERAM anomalies at 16 different ARTCC as an ERAM Subject
Matter Expert (SME).
And at times made recommendations, for what kind of adaptations to local Automation could be made to enhance ERAMs performance at
a particular facility.
Experience
Air Traffic Controller , 08/1983 to 12/2015 Company Name ï¼​ City , State
While working more than 32 years as an En Route Air Traffic Controller (ATCS) in the En Route environment, I maintained the safe, orderly, and
expeditious flow of air traffic in the NAS. I was an expert at various disciplines of air traffic control while maintaining at least the minimum
separation standard's, and adhering to procedures and regulation as set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration.
04/2013 to 01/2015
Was a National En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) Subject Mater Expert (SME) and visited 16 En-Route Air Traffic Control
Centers (ARTCC) and identified ERAM anomalies. In addition to documenting ERAM's undesirable process, also recommending
adaptation changes that resulted in the desired behavior for the affected facility. When not documenting ERAM anomalies, or consulting on
ERAM work-a-rounds, I conducted training of the controllers at the sectors working traffic, concerning ERAM functionality. During my
collateral duties as an IOA team member and a National ERAM SME, I was able to maintain my currency every month, and conducted
OJT.
09/2008 to 04/2013
Served as a National SME on the FAA's Independent Operational Assessment (IOA) team. As a team member I collected data and
collaborated on the final report concerning the operational readiness for ERAM's National Deployment.
28 years of experience working transition sectors from domestic Air Traffic Services to Oceanic Air Traffic services. This airspace required
manual coordination on route, altitude and time estimates with Oakland Oceanic sectors; as well as establishing oceanic separation standers
for the affected flight before entering an oceanic sector. This Radar-Non Radar environment required me to correlate flight plans with
incoming and outgoing tracks, and either terminate or re-identify the flight in a Radar environment.
Worked Arrival and Departure traffic In and out of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) for 32 years. This required closely working
with a level 5 Approach control, facilitating the separation of aircraft during the transition phase of a flight from the terminal to the En Route
environment. This requires a strong working knowledge of geography for expediting flight on their flight plans, while working within flow
control restriction, weather, and volume limitations. And before the wide acceptance of GPS navigation this required long range vectoring,
which required consideration of weather and traffic situations. Sequenced traffic for Seattle Approach (S46) from high sectors (above
FL230) and low sectors (below FL240) as well as converging routes, in sectors that were over the Cascade Mountains, which introduced
weather, and train factors.
With 28 years of experience working aircraft in a transitional phase of flight (back and forth from terminal and En Route) I have extensive
knowledge and experience with different types of route structures including the new Advanced R-NAV SID's and STAR's with their
descend and climb via phases of transitioning to and from the En Route to Terminal environment. As well as more conventional types of En
Route navigation like Jet routs, victor airway, ""Q"" routs, ""K"" fixes, as well as point-to point GPS/RNAV/ Latitude/longitude Navigation, and
conventional SID's and STAR's.
I worked daily military training flights on IR and VR routes, airspace reservation both moving ALTRAV and special Use airspace (SUA). I
have experience with Naval (P3, F18, E2, A6 and EA6 aircraft, Air force (F16, F15, F4, C17, C141, KC35, B2 and B52), Army (A10,
UH60, and AH64), and Air National Guard (F4, F15 and F16) and their missions. The sectors I was certified on had Naval, Air force, and
Army bases and a joint civilian/Air National Guard base. My experience involves clearing fighters into and recovering fighters from special
use airspace, as well as air refueling missions and helicopters for the Army back and forth from base to training grounds.
Controlled cross border flights between the USA and Canada for over 32 years. Experience includes passing manual time estimates, flight
plans, and making and taking manual hand offs via voice calls. Also experience at some of the limitations of CATTS (the Canadian version
of ERAM) and ERAM's interfaces are.
Have 32 years experience providing approach control services at uncontrolled, and tower controlled airports. One of the tower-controlled
airports was Paine Field in Everett, WA. Pain field (PAE) is a key airport in the Boeing Company manufacturing process, and worked
closely with Boeing in their testing and certification process for new airplanes. Also Pain field is an airport that many new pilots would go
and do multiple practice approaches for training. This environment meant the traffic pattern at Paine field had a large variety of aircraft,
Large commercial aircraft, navy fighters and small single engine trainers, this required the separation and sequence the traffic but apply wake
turbulence procedures in many instances. While providing approach control services at PAE, we meet the requirements to use 3NM
separation in most of the area. This required vigilantes as to how fare the aircraft was from the RADAR antenna, and adding to the
complexity of this particular airspace, was the West side was over water, or low lying land; but the train rose very quickly to the East,
required different techniques for lost com or vectoring to the final approach course.
Preformed duties as a SME in Plans and Programs (ZSE-510) consulting on the feasibly of releasing equipment to Airways and Facilities for
maintained.
Preformed SME duties in Airspace (ZSE-520) working on letters of agreements with adjacent facilities, as well as airspace changes. During
My involvement as an Airspace SME, I was part of a team that was involved in some major sector realignments that facilitated arrivals and
departures from the South and East at SEA; as well as traffic transiting between Seattle (SEA) and Portland OR (PDX). During this
realignment we also collaborated on procedures and sector alignment for Vancouver Canada (YVR) Arrivals and Departures from the
South. Also I was also involved in the initial stages of National High Altitude Redesign.
April 1991 I was certified as a Controller in Charge (CIC). As CIC I was responsible for the same tasks that a First Line supervisor would
for dally operations. Assigning work, opening and closing sectors, handling Emergences, and approving leave and shift changes with in
prescribed guild lines.
December 1987 I was certified as an On The Job Instructor (OJTI).
November 1986 I Certified as a Certified Professional Controller (CPC) in Area C of Seattle ARTCC. Then in September 1988 I
voluntary transferred to Area A at Seattle ARTCC, and became area rated May 1989 until retirement January 2016.
