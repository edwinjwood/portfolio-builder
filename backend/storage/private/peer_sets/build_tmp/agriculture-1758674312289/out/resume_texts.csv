01/2003 to Current
VP, Principal Company Name ï¼​ City , State
Architected and developed an innovative product called ""IBOR 1.0"" to provide real-time market values,exposures and related analytics
using operational data store(ODS). This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g.
pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at
Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.
Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment
for a mission critical product.
Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took
ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for
more than 10 years in a row.
Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I
was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate
new quality products as well as support existing products in production.
Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-
memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at
Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production
since 2013.
Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions
in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.
Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform.
IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure
information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data
and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and
analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud
environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.
My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect
on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly
available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and
investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due
to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from
monolithic architecture to service based architecture.
Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The
ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to
Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.
Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment
decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning
complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.
Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process
to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market. Integrate metadata with Collibra to show data
lineage, data dependency and other related information across multiple applications

Professional Summary
I joined the Ministry of Education in 1982 and was posted at the R.M.Bailey Senior High School where I remained for seventeen and a half
wonderful years. I served as Head of the Guidance Department from 1991 to 1999 until my redeployment to Special Services Section to oversee
the Guidance & Counseling Unit upon the retirement of the former officer. I enjoyed my experience at R.M.Baily and have had the pleasure of
working with and assisting students even after my departure from the school, I am still counseling many of them and their children today.
I have had the opportunity of supervising the Guidance & Counseling Unit over the past sixteen years and watched it grow from forty- two (42)
counselors in 1999 to one hundred and thirty two (132) in 2015, posted in ninety-four schools on fourteen islands and cays throughout the
country. During my leadership, we collaborated with the College of The Bahamas and Kent State University and established a Master's of
Education Degree Program in School Counseling from 2001 to 2011. Eighty- nine (89) persons obtained the Masters Degree, and the unit has the
largest amount of employees with this Degree in the Ministry of Education. I realized in order for the unit to move forward, ongoing training was a
requirement for all officers, which kept them informed about the latest techniques and strengthened areas of concern. We also established a crisis
team that assists with grief and disaster counseling.
The needs of students were being met but those of the employees were not and after visiting the school district in Dallas Texas, I learned about the
Employee Assistance Program, and implemented it at the Ministry of Education on a smaller scale. This proved to be very successful but the need
for expansion was necessary. Upon the retirement of Mrs. Pansy Hamilton Brown, Iris Strachan, and Clevette Gibson took the reins and took
EAP to the next level. The demands on the officers made me realize that the service needed to be made available to all government employees and
the idea to expand the service was decided. I enjoyed my role as Senior Education Officer and if given the opportunity would like to be a part of
taking EAP to the next level.
