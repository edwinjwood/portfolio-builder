Profile
I am a highly qualified K-12 Vocal Music Teacher holding a BS in Music Education from Kansas State University and Sterling College. (1999) I
believe in building a solid foundation in the formative years and helping students find many different ways to experience music.I lead them to
develop passion in music and performance that leads them to continue in Music in Middle, High School and beyond. Providing multiple delivery
methods in teaching, assures each student will experience, learn and retain key music knowledge in they way that they learn best. Using Brain
Research Strategies, coupled with Multiple Intelligences, HOTS, and Explicit Instruction, I have found a way to teach students Music through all
Core areas. Music is a Universal Language. Regardless of gender or race, music looks the same on paper but is experienced in numerous ways
through Culture. I am passionate about teaching!

Summary
My applied experience in elementary level teaching combined with my B.A in History/Music as well Alt. Certification (K-5), makes me a worthy
contender for a teacher position at your school .Utilizing my skills and expertise, I am eager to become a key member of your team. As specified in
the enclosed resume, I offer you the following attributes in order to contribute to your ongoing success: * Well versed in assisting children in build
social, cognitive, emotional, and physical skills. * Adept at providing a stimulating conducive classroom environment. * Special talent for utilizing
the highest quality teaching resources and classroom materials. It is paramount that in order to become the best teacher, good interaction with the
students is essential - aside from imparting good knowledge. The expectation of what the students think and how they would think in a particular
state of affairs is equally important in my point of view. In addition, I apply an innovative teaching approach which includes the incorporation of
21st century skill sets that will prepare my students to compete with other students both nationally and internationally. Of all my strengths, I take
extreme pride in the patience and dedication required to meet the needs of children from socially and culturally diverse backgrounds. My insight
not only comes from my years in the classroom as a teacher, but also from my years a pupil. Having lived abroad for many of my formative years,
as well as some after college, I understand the delicate balance that is needed to make learning inclusive to all. CERTIFIED ELEMENTARY

Other Accomplishments
Last year I was asked to administer the GATE after school program. Together, the GATE identified students and I, created a school newspaper.
We named it the Jr Journal and invented five topics that would be in every issue. I helped create an outline and template that our reporters could
follow and eventually do independently. Each student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article
for that section. They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper
template. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish
four issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school
newspaper in High School. I had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced
brains to work. It was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year."

Accomplishments
While working for Beauty Brands I received two awards. I received the Award of Excellence and Shift Manager of the Year. The Award of
Excellence is a company wide award and is awarded to one person from each district. Out of seven locations I was chosen for my district. I was
presented the award at Beauty Brands annual banquet in Kansas City. I accepted the award from the founder and CEO and was recognized in
front of all of home office, location managers, and other award winners. The next year I was awarded with Shift Manager of the Year for my
district.
Experience
I have a little over 100 hours of observation and participation field experience. Sixty hours of my field experience are observations from algebra I
at Lees Summit High School summer school and 6th grade math and social studies at Brittany Hill. Fifteen hours were spent at Holden Middle
School tutoring 6th through 8th graders in various contents. I spent twelve hours observing special education students in both a general education
and special education classrooms. I finished about twenty hours in a 6th grade math class at Grain Valley South Middle School. One of my peers
and I taught three different lessons and led several small groups in discussions about various math articles. One lesson we taught was reviewing
order of operations. Since the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various
problems using multiple operations. We played â€œI have, who has?â€​ As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the
board so that they could visualize it and write it down. Students would call out the answer when it was their card and then we solved the problem
on the board as a class before we moved on to the next card. The students really enjoyed this because it was something that we did all together
and they saw it as more of a game and thought it was fun.
