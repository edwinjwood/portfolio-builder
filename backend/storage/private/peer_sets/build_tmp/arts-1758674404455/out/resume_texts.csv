department, I have had the opportunity to build my experience across grade levels and develop curriculum after curriculum to suit the needs of

Office Manager/ Program Director
April 2014 to Current Company Name ï¼​ City , State
The dojo I work at was sold to new owners in 2015; I stayed on board with the new owners and have improved many areas of their
business.
The biggest improvements I made were things that save them money.Â The martial arts school I work at used a website that charged them
$300 a month for information that was just not needed and therefore a waste of money.Â I came up with our own in house system.
I identified what information (tuition, attendance, rank, student's info etc.) we needed on a daily basis, and how to get to that information
quickly.Â I simply used the excel program, came up with a sheet for each class and modify it to be easy to use for anyone.
We can access any information we need quickly and timely; without paying this website.
We were paying a lot for internet and phone.Â I called around and verified price and contract for a commercial account.Â I was able to
negotiate a great price and bundle our services.
We sell a lot of merchandise at the martial arts gym.Â I set up all new whole sale accounts; for equipment and uniform needs.Â I
researched pricing for equipment, uniforms and office needs (ink, paper, paper towels) and modified our suppliers.Â I was able to establish
new relationships and new pricing.
The dojo relocated in 2016.Â When we took over a new space; I planned everything.Â The bathroom remodel I came up with the
complete redesign and ,some of the construction, I actually did myself.
I handled every aspect of moving from one location to a new location.Â In a time limit of 14 days, we not only moved but opened our
doors at new location; all during Christmas/New Year Holiday.
Since working for ATA, I have revised the way we communicate to students and parents.Â I updated our facebook web page, came out
with a monthly newsletter, put in place an announcement board, and update our webpage bi-weekly.
I have planned and executed new rank testings, tournaments, birthday parties, and planned our company events for an entire year in
advance.
I have increased customer satisfaction and supported customers in areas such as conflict resolution in tuition issues, problem solved our
cancel and hold policy, resolved our turnaround time on merchandise orders, clarified rules and equipment requirements in writing and
revamped our leadership program.
IÂ manage new student recruitment, marketing needs, student registration, community outreach, parent communications, staff management,
ordering supplies, bookkeeping, upgrade selling, and receiving payments Improved family and parent relations for the school.Â I created
and implemented new schedule, new calendar of events, worked closely with the owners to design and publish the company's website

Accomplishments
When I first started to work for Boost Mobile I didn't know a thing about sales or phones at all. I was so insecure about everything, until one day I
decided to put all the petty thoughts aside and show my true strength and confidence. My sale skills went from zero to none to one hundred. My
best day is when I sold 31 phones in one day with accessories, I was so proud about how hard I work to get to my goal. I have a lot of thanks to
my coworkers because they showed me how to push myself to my highest limit and conquer my goals. They also showed me how to be a team
player and to always help everyone and not just customers. One of the best months I had was when I sold 199 phones and over $3,088 worth in
accessories. Routinely helped as many as ten customers each day in a high-volume retail outlet. Fulfilled all supervisory duties when Store Manager
was on vacation. I'm very proud on what I've learn over the couple of months working at Boost Mobile of Mobile Factory, I thank them for
helping me develop my skills and making me into the person I am today.

Qualifications
Productivity improvement Multi-unit operations management
Detail-oriented Natural leader
Superb time management skills Unsurpassed work ethic
Process improvement Results-oriented
Relevant Experience
In my time as the Director of Programming Arts at DSU, I haveÂ drasticallyÂ improved the bottom line of shows at the Cox Performing Arts
Center and the Tanner Amphitheater and have simultaneously created and funded permanent improvements and endowments. The Trailblazer
Summer Concert Series at the Tanner went from consistently losing money to net profit in both 2015 and 2016. By changing the way tickets are
marketed, I was able to generate a 30% increase in season ticket memberships to the Celebrity Concert Series in only one year. I have
alsoÂ created a scholarship program for College of the Arts students at DSU which financially supported twelve students in 2016. I sought and
obtained donations from the community in order to completely renovate the Cox Center's Green room and made permanent improvements to the
aesthetics of the stage at Tanner Amphitheater including adding shade to the performing area as well as new lighting and sound equipment. All of
this was completed without receiving any additional funding from the University.
Experience
03/2014 to Current
Director of Programming Arts Company Name ï¼​ City , State As the Director of Programming Arts at Dixie State University, I am responsible for
the cultural arts activities at multiple venues. The Cox Performing Arts Center (1200 seats) is the home of the Celebrity Concert Series (CCS)
which has been the premierÂ performing arts series in the areaÂ since 1958. I am responsible for the management of the CCSÂ and my duties
include overseeing all programming, marketing, hospitality, financial accounts, administration,Â and fulfillment. I am also responsible for interacting
with and guiding the CCSÂ Board of Directors comprised of community leaders and performing arts enthusiasts. The CCS plays host toÂ a wide
variety of entertainment genres. Our current season includes Manhattan Transfer with Take 6, the Utah Symphony, The Drifters, GENTRI, and
Canadian Brass to name a few. I am also responsible, during the summer months, for all facets of programming and management of the Tanner
Amphitheater (1600 seats) in Springdale, Utah at the entrance to Zion National Park. Before I came to DSU, this outdoor theater was used for a
handful of local artists playing weekend shows on a bare stage. I have completely rethought this venue by adding visual design elements,
incorporating concessions and catering, seeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol, and structuring the programming around two series
formats. The first series is comprised of festival-style events where each performance date is focused on a specific genre of musicÂ and marketed
as a standalone event with multiple artists hired for each show. The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an
important, well-attended festival that was supported both by the community and the tourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion
National Park.Â The second series isÂ an original show called, ""Sanctuary: The Story of Zion"" which was written to correspond with the
centennial celebration of our National Parks. I co-created, produced, and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance and
tech team. This show was based on feedback we received from the area business owners when asked what kind of entertainment would best be
supported by the tourists who come to the area. Sanctuary tells the story of Zion National Park though storytelling, music, and the unique usage of
video projection to share testimonials of many prominent Zion Park officials as well as world-class artists and climbers who call Zion home.

creative minded engineers and musicians.Â Spiral Studios has also been involved with many festival-style shows by hiring and managing artists
andÂ providing A/V equipment. Â In my time at Spiral Studios, I was able to create many industry relationships with both entertainers and
management.Â These relationships have allowed for a deep understanding of performing arts from the perspective of an entertainer as well as a
director.Â This knowledge informs my decisions and gives me a unique perspective in my role as Director of Programming. Â I continue to own

Additional Information
Growing up in Indonesia as the son of missionaries, I attended Central Java Inter-Mission School (now, Mountainview International Christian
School) in Salatiga. My formative educational experience happened under the guidance of teachers and an institution that had an abiding faith in
God and the the transformational power of Jesus Christ. I would deeply appreciate the opportunity to allow my faith in the revolutionary power of
the cross to inform and infuse all aspect of my teaching practice. I seek to emulate the fine example made manifest in the lives of the teacher that
taught me at CJIMS. I believe this is the kind of ministry that God has interwoven into the fibers of my very being.

Accomplishments
When I first started to work for Boost Mobile I didn't know a thing about sales or phones at all. I was so insecure about everything, until one day I
decided to put all the insecurity thoughts aside and show my true strength and confidence. My sale skills went from zero to none to one hundred.
My best day is when I sold 31 phones in one day with accessories, I was so proud about how hard I work to get to my goal. I have a lot of thanks
to my coworkers because they showed me how to push myself to my highest limit and conquer my goals. They also showed me how to be a team
player and to always help everyone and not just customers. One of the best months was when I sold 145 phones and over $3,088 worth in
accessories. Routinely helped as many as ten customers each day in a high-volume retail outlet.I also fulfilled all supervisory duties when the store
manager was on vacation. I'm very proud on what I've learn over the couple of months working at Boost Mobile of Mobile Factory, I thank them
for helping me develop my skills and making me into the person I know I am.
