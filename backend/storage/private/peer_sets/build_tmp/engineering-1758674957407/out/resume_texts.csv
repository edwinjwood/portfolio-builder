Summary
I am seeking a position within a Maintenance/Engineering department. I have completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Technology
with a concentration in Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science from Middle Tennessee State University. I feel that I am a great
candidate to be employed in technical role due my education and experience with ArcelorMittal and PepsiCo. Course work for my degree
included instrumentation controls and engineering economy, which is beneficial for technical manufacturing positions overseeing capital spend.
Instrumentation controls class work show the design of electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems and other associated equipment that work in
relation to one another. Engineering Economy provided me with the concepts of OEE, supply chain, and project cost effectiveness. I was able to
use my education and gain experience with ArcelorMittal as an Operations Technician. As an Operations Technician, I was responsible for the
OEE of automated weld cells. To ensure productivity, I reviewed faults in PLC programming, Fanuc Robot programming, or mechanically which
required my problem solving abilities. I was required to understand CAD drawings and wiring schematics to troubleshoot and install components
on the line, in which one has to have great analytical skills to accomplish. In my most recent experience with Frito Lay, I have gained experience
through the Project Engineer & Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader positions. The Project Engineer role required me to have excellent

WTR-RX/TX SYNTH in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 6 months I lead a team of 4 which supported a project which was being
done at Qualcomm USA.
My role in this project was to have regular discussion with US designers to understand their requirements, later communicate these
requirements with my team and also track the deliverables.
I also handled some portion of the TOP level layout tasks.
I worked on blocks like HFVCO, Regulator, VCO Buffer and LPF during this project.
I used Gantt chart to schedule the tasks for each individual.
I also used XL sheet to track the progress and issues on a more micro level.
WTR QLNA Daisy Chain 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 0.5 months For this particular project I had regular discussions with the
Packaging team to create the best Daisy Chain structures for a WLP CHIP which I had work on previously.

There we few issues seen with this blocks performance in post silicon verifications.
My role in this task was to identify the IQ imbalance which caused performance issues and fix them.
I was able to meet the designers requirements in this task and was very much appreciated by him once the task was done.
WTR Low Band Low Noise Amplifier 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 3 months This is a Low Band LNA which operates between
860 - 900 Mhz frequencies.
Here layout constraints like coupling, inductance and symmetry were taken care while doing layout.
Majorly the input devices to which RF_IN signal were given extra care w.r.t coupling and symmetry.
WTR Mixer, Attenuator in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 10 months This is the first project which I worked on in RF domain and I
had a wonderful experience working on this project.
The blocks that I worked in this project were for a product chip and hence the amount of learning was tremendous in this project.
