# Code of Conduct

All contributors and maintainers are expected to follow a basic code of conduct:

- Be respectful and professional.
- Assume good intent and communicate clearly.
- Avoid discriminatory or harassing language.

If you experience or observe behavior that violates this code, contact the project owner.

This is a lightweight internal code of conduct; for public projects consider adopting the full Contributor Covenant: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/
